<p style="margin-top:45px;">LONDON — People who have been infected with Covid-19 are likely to have some
  form of immunity for at least five months, according to early results of a major new study in the U.K.</p>
<p>Preliminary findings in Public Health England’s SIREN study — which has
  surveyed thousands of U.K. health care workers in a bid to establish
  whether prior infection protects against future infection —
  found antibodies provide an 83% rate of protection against reinfection,
  compared to people who have not had the disease before.</p>
